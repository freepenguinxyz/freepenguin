<h1>FreePenguin is closing</h1>
FreePenguin has been closed. I would like to thank everyone for playing the game while it was alive. <br/>
A part of you will probably search for another server to move on to. If so, please DO NOT play CPO. They are to blame for this whole situation. <br/>
It was a good time for me being in the CPPS community for 10 years, I will never forget all the good and not so good stuff that happened in it. It truly feels like the end of an era in my life, but it is the time for me to go on.<br/>
Thank you all for being awesome, see you around.<br/>
